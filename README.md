This experiment tests if the color of a heatmap affects people's ability to comprehend data. For this experiment, we developed a program that automatically generates various dots of a certain color with different temperatures. Two dots would have a black dot in the middle, and the users would be asked to guess the percentage of the lighter color relative to the darker one. We hope this will allow us to see which color produced the most accuracy, thus showing the ideal color for a heat map.

//place figures in order from most accurate to least accurate, then any other charts you have

Technical achievements:
Created a script that automatically generates random heatmaps for the experiment instead of hard coding them.
